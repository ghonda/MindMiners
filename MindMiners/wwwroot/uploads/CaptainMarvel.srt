1
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,676
Do you know what time it is?

2
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:14,905
Can't sleep.

3
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,066
There are tabs for that.

4
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:50,566
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

5
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:51,953
Dreams again.

6
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:57,940
Want to fight?

7
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,479
- I slipped.
- Right. You slipped.

8
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:05,940
As a result of me punching
you in the face.

9
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:08,096
I was already slipping when you
happened to punch me in the face.

10
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,526
But you most probably did.

11
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:11,807
Tell me about this dream.

12
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:14,648
Anything new?

13
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
No.

14
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,190
You have to let go of the past.

15
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:23,315
Can't remember my past.

16
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:26,495
It's causing you doubt. And
doubt makes you vulnerable.

17
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,212
Control it.

18
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,051
Learn to control again. You'll have to
commune with the Supreme Intelligence.

19
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:44,450
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

20
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:49,848
Humor is a distraction.

21
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:55,033
Anger... anger
represents the enemy.

22
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,921
120 days since the
last Skrull attack.

23
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:13,046
Has anyone ever seen what the Supreme
Intelligence really looks like?

24
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:16,959
No one can look upon the Supreme
Intelligence in its true form.

25
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,181
You know that.

26
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:24,765
Our subconcious chooses the way
they appear to us, so it's sacred.

27
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:26,293
It's personal.

28
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,550
No Kree divulges it. Ever.

29
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:29,804
Who do you see?

30
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:31,797
- Your brother.
- No.

31
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,023
- Father.
- No.

32
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:35,164
- Your old commander.
- Vers.

33
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,109
It's me you see, isn't it?

34
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:39,656
I see what you're trying to do.

35
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:41,483
- Is it working?
- Yes.

36
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,397
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

37
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:47,038
What is the point of giving me these
if you don't want me to use them?

38
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,858
I want you to use them.

39
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:53,116
The Supreme Intelligence gave me
responsibility of showing you how to use them.

40
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,162
I know how.

41
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,693
Well if that were true, you could've
knocked me down without it.

42
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:00,021
Control your impulses.

43
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,021
Stop using this, and
start using this.

44
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:06,005
I want you...

45
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:08,435
to be the best
version of yourself.

46
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:50,562
Vers.

47
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:52,851
Intelligence.

48
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:56,359
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

49
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:57,624
I am.

50
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:01,109
You struggle with your emotions.

51
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:04,156
With your past, what fuels them.

52
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:09,038
You are just one victim of the
Skrull expansion that has

53
00:06:09,063 --> 00:06:11,648
threatened our civilization for centuries.

54
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:17,085
Imposters who silently infiltrate,
then take over our planets.

55
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:23,662
Horrors that you remember,
and so much that you do not.

56
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:29,323
It's all blank...

57
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:30,713
My life.

58
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:33,995
You're supposed to take the
form of who I used to admire,

59
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:38,713
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

60
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,768
Perhaps, this is a mercy.

61
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,987
Sparing you from a deeper pain.

62
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:47,001
Freeing you to do
what all Kree must.

63
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:50,301
Put your people's needs
before your own.

64
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,267
We've given you a great gift.

65
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:55,650
The chance to fight for
the good of all Kree.

66
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:58,040
I want to serve.

67
00:06:58,056 --> 00:06:59,970
Then master yourself.

68
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:03,149
What was given can
be taken away.

69
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,357
I won't let you down.

70
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:10,470
We'll know soon enough.

71
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,181
You have a mission.

72
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,439
Serve well and with honor.

73
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:38,827
This can't be good.

74
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:41,053
Must be another Skrull attack.

75
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,842
Whatever it is, it's big.

76
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,873
- Has a Skrull ever simmed you?
- Once.

77
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,045
- It was deeeply disturbing.
- Why?

78
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,640
Because I stared into the
face of my mortal enemy

79
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,608
and then they stared
back with my own.

80
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:55,632
Maybe if you were more attractive,
then it would be less disturbing.

81
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,748
You think you're funny.
I'm not laughing.

82
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:01,640
- You never laugh.
- I laugh. On the inside.

83
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,390
I'm not doing it now.

84
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:05,828
It's funny, 'cause objectively
speaking, you're quite handsome.

85
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:06,843
Well, thank you.

86
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:09,194
Listen up, team. Knock it off.

87
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:10,898
Right.

88
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,874
Prepare for...

89
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:17,514
A search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr.

90
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,413
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

91
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:22,288
This time, Torfa.

92
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:25,374
Soh-Larr sent us a warning signal.
It was intercepted,

93
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:26,984
and his cover's blown.

94
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,468
The Skrull general Talos has
sent kill units to find him.

95
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:33,957
Should they reach
him before we do,

96
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:37,708
the intelligence he's acquired over
three years is as good as theirs.

97
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,880
The Accusers will bomb a Skrull
stronghold here in the south.

98
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:46,514
We slip in, we locate
Soh-Larr, and we get out.

99
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,805
Leaving them none the wiser.

100
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:52,125
The Torfan populace, we are
not to interfere with them,

101
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:57,102
nor them with us. Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

102
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,078
Proceed with caution.

103
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,562
Follow protocol before
extracting hiim.

104
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:04,977
This is a dangerous mission.

105
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,422
We must all be ready to
join the Collective...

106
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,242
if that is our fate today.

107
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,259
- For the good of all Kree.
- For the good of all Kree!

108
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:24,194
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

109
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:26,631
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation.

110
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,864
Locals on the periphery.

111
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,051
- Maybe a dozen.
- Minn-Erva?

112
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:55,634
Do you read me? Anybody copy?

113
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,803
His beacon's coming from that temple.
Let's move.

114
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:15,490
No. This is a perfect
spot for an ambush.

115
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,584
- Only one way in and one way out.
- We can get past the locals.

116
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:20,982
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.

117
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,764
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

118
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:24,256
No, you won't.

119
00:11:28,724 --> 00:11:30,809
Right. We keep a close radius.

120
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:33,325
We lose comms, we
meet back in here.

121
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,021
Come on.

122
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,435
- Att-Lass, you getting this?
- Copy. I see them.

123
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:16,114
Minn-Erva, do you
have eyes on us?

124
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:21,271
- Keep them back. Minn-Erva?
- Does anybody copy?

125
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,724
I don't wanna hurt you.

126
00:12:29,468 --> 00:12:31,249
Keep back!

127
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,750
Stand back!

128
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:43,680
They're locals. I found two dead. No green.
They're just starving.

129
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:13,203
- HGX-78.
- 2RT-79. 8XX.

130
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:17,744
Get back.

131
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:27,711
Skrulls!

132
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:46,255
Vers!

133
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:50,589
Vers... it's an ambush...

134
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,180
Incoming!

135
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:18,981
Talk to me. Do you copy?

136
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:24,645
How did you know the code?

137
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,231
How about I tell you my secret...

138
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,083
...when you tell me yours.

139
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:36,331
Let's open her up.

140
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,508
- Where are we?
- Standby.

141
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:55,646
Where's your head at?

142
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,481
In the clouds. Where's yours?

143
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,129
On my shoulders.

144
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,832
About to show these boys how we do it.
You ready?

145
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:05,942
- Higher, further, faster, baby.
- That's right.

146
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,629
This can't be right.

147
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:20,667
Go back even further.

148
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:27,318
You're too fast! You
need to go slow!

149
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,720
Now who is this person?
Are--- are we in the right...

150
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:45,191
What the hell are you thinking?
You don't belong out here!

151
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,903
I think we went back too far.

152
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,996
You won't let me drive.

153
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:49,504
Let me try it back.

154
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,356
What the hell is wrong with her?

155
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,466
You'll kill yourself.

156
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,466
They'll never let you fly.

157
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:10,981
I am not the only one
who's confused here.

158
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:14,568
You're a decent pilot, but
you're too emotional.

159
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,513
You do know why they call
it a "cockpit", don't you?

160
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:27,443
...Huge rubble,
throughout the cosmos...

161
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:30,475
...shift the moon and the sun
and the stars in the sky.

162
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:34,655
And soon, they'll wile away.
Flew out throughout the night.

163
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,007
Did you see it?

164
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:43,077
Get your butts inside, it's time to eat.
Prepare for take-off, Lt. Trouble.

165
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,259
Charming memory.

166
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:46,923
Hang on. I think I got it.

167
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:52,919
Goose likes you.

168
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:54,958
She doesn't typically
take to people.

169
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,582
- Early start to your morning?
- Late night, actually.

170
00:16:57,598 --> 00:17:00,465
I can't sleep when there's work to do.
Sound familiar?

171
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:03,144
Flying airplanes never
feels like work.

172
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:07,089
- Wonderful view, isn't it?
- I prefer the view from up there.

173
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:08,559
You'll get there
soon enough, ace.

174
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:10,279
Wait, wait, wait, that's her.

175
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,146
- Get her back.
- Standby.

176
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,492
...sound familiar...

177
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:19,609
Wonderful view, isn't it?

178
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:24,187
- i prefer the view from up there.
- You'll get there soon enough...

179
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:26,899
What's that on her shirt?
I couldn't read it.

180
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:30,602
Wonderful view, isn't it?

181
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:35,472
- I prefer the view from up there.
- You'll get there soon enough...

182
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:39,019
Focus... Look down.

183
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:40,800
Focus.

184
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:44,559
Pegasus... Dr. Wendy Lawson.
That's her.

185
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:46,975
- Do you hear that, too?
- Now track the location.

186
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:49,953
Got it.

187
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:53,498
Now track Lawson until we
find the energy signature.

188
00:17:57,363 --> 00:17:58,964
Interesting.

189
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:02,581
Hold on...

190
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,369
- Go back right before this.
- Okay.

191
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:11,286
Now let's see where
you're headed.

192
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:15,895
That's right. Look at the
coordinates... Focus.

193
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:22,072
That's it. That's it.
Almost there...

194
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:23,822
You're almost there. Don't fight it.

195
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,571
Focus! Focus!

196
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,896
Get her back! Get her back now.

197
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:55,440
Do we have any information
we can act on?

198
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:58,619
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.

199
00:18:58,656 --> 00:18:59,789
We're on our way.

200
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,494
Then dig, dig, dig, deeper.

201
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:05,361
Lawson is our link to
that lightspeed engine.

202
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,150
And everything we're after.

203
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,116
That did something.
Try that again?

204
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,832
Not yet!

205
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:44,791
What did you do to me?

206
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:46,931
We're just after little information.

207
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:50,362
- What did you put in my head?
- Nothing that wasn't already there.

208
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:53,654
But those aren't my memories.

209
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,013
Yeah, it's like a
bad trip in there.

210
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,591
I'm not surprised you
can't keep it straight.

211
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:00,529
They really did a number on you.

212
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,673
Enough of your mindgames.
What do you want?

213
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:09,576
We're looking for the location of a Dr.
Lawson and her lightspeed engine.

214
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:11,917
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

215
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,737
Then why is she in your head?

216
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,451
Either of you wouldn't happen to know
how these things come off, would you?

217
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,397
No? Fine.

218
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:24,332
Hey.

219
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,732
You do know why
they call it co...

220
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:51,073
Leaving so soon?

221
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:52,979
We just got to know each other.

222
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:18,728
Vers to Starforce Command.
Do you read me?

223
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:22,181
Hello?

224
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,587
Do you copy?

225
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,144
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

226
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:56,981
Is this C-53?

227
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,680
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

228
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,156
Yeah. I understand you.

229
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:07,071
Good. Are you in charge of
security for this district?

230
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:12,282
Sort of.... The movie
theater has its own gate.

231
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:15,899
Where can I find
communication equipment?

232
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:23,296
Thank you.

233
00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:58,851
Track the pod and find the girl.

234
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,671
She knows more than she knows.

235
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
Hey!

236
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:08,369
This one's taken.

237
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:19,975
Come on...

238
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,946
Vers...

239
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,626
- Clarify: CQC-39.
- GRX8-1600.

240
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,813
And I'm fine, thank
you for asking.

241
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:32,220
- Is everyone okay? What happened?
- Skrull ambush.

242
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,321
I thought we'd lost you.

243
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:36,642
- Did you find Soh-Larr?
- It wasn't Soh-Larr.

244
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:39,056
Talos simmed him. Even knew his code.

245
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:41,243
That's impossible.

246
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:43,474
That code was buried
in his subconscious.

247
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:45,631
The Skrulls messed with my mind.
The machine that they used,

248
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,131
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

249
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:51,092
- Vers, where are you?
- I'm on Planet C-53.

250
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,177
The Skrulls are looking
for someone named Lawson.

251
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:55,202
Who?

252
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:58,474
She's who I see...

253
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:00,263
She's what?

254
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:02,428
Vers.

255
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,295
Vers, what?

256
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:07,576
She's a scientist.

257
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,624
They think that she's cracked
the code on lightspeed tech.

258
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:12,702
I have to get to her before they do or
else they'll be able to invade galaxies.

259
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,476
No. You've been
caught once already.

260
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:17,882
How far is C-53?

261
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:20,405
Closest jump point is 22 hours.

262
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,077
Vers, hold your position
until we get there.

263
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:25,008
Keep your comms online
so we can contact...

264
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:27,039
No. What if they get
a hold of it before...

265
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,093
Vers.

266
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:33,987
Vers.

267
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:36,768
Vers!

268
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,588
If the Skrulls capture
her, she's compromised.

269
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:42,611
She's stronger than you think.

270
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:45,752
Ever been to C-53?

271
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:47,182
Once.

272
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:50,181
It's a real shithole.

273
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:12,038
You called this in?

274
00:28:26,328 --> 00:28:28,187


275
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:32,305
Excuse me, Miss.

276
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,351
Did you know anything
about a lady blowing a hole

277
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:38,004
through the roof of that
blockbuster over there?

278
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:41,028
Witness says she looks
dressed for laser tag.

279
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:46,141
Yeah, I think she went that way.

280
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:49,587
Uhh, I'd like to ask
you some questions.

281
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,891
Maybe give you the 411 on
the late-night drive-bys.

282
00:28:54,672 --> 00:28:56,266
Can I see some
identification, please?

283
00:28:56,298 --> 00:29:00,641
Vers. Kree Starforce. We don't carry
our identification on little cards.

284
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:01,938
Vers!

285
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:04,087
Starforce.

286
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:06,955
How long do you
plan to be in town?

287
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,064
Oh, I'll be out of your
hair, soon as I track down

288
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,182
the Skrulls that are
infiltrating your planet.

289
00:29:12,495 --> 00:29:13,807
Skrulls?

290
00:29:14,323 --> 00:29:18,221
Shapeshifters? They can transform
into any lifeform down to their DNA?

291
00:29:19,745 --> 00:29:21,815
Oh, boy. You guys don't
have any clue, do you?

292
00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:23,807
Whoa, whoa ,whoa. Hold up.

293
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,865
How do we know...

294
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:30,091
you're not one of
those shapeshifters?

295
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:34,130
Congratulations, Agent Fury. You're
finally asking the right question.

296
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:37,052
No. Congratulations to
you, Starforce lady!

297
00:29:37,115 --> 00:29:39,178
You're under arrest.

298
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:48,231
Let's roll!

299
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:50,818
Rook! Let's roll!

300
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:02,429
- Did you see her weapon?
- I did not.

301
00:30:46,247 --> 00:30:48,995
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

302
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:12,293
"Trust me, true believer.
Trust me..."

303
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:19,522
"Trust me, true believer..."

304
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,883
Train's headed to
a tunnel up ahead.

305
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,296
Let's greet them at the station.

306
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:23,096
Agent Fury, this is Agent Coulson.
Umm..

307
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:26,900
Uh, I'm still here at the
Blockbuster, and uh...

308
00:33:27,946 --> 00:33:32,453
Where'd everybody go? I
finished collecting evidence...

309
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:10,816
Official SHIELD activity.
Stay back.

310
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:01,302
Nice scuba suit.

311
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,822
Lighten up, honey, huh?
Gonna smile for me?

312
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:38,086
All life on Earth is carbon-based.
Not this guy.

313
00:36:38,477 --> 00:36:42,469
Whatever he runs on, it's not
on the periodic table.

314
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:45,453
So you're saying he's
not from around here?

315
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:47,911
Hey, how's your eye?

316
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:50,473
Well, I'd say fine.

317
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:53,387
But it can't believe
what it's seeing.

318
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:57,391
You said...

319
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:00,649
this thing looked like Coulson?

320
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:02,633
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

321
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:05,008
And the woman said
that there were more?

322
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,665
The word she used
was infiltration.

323
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,512
- You believe her?
- Not till I saw this.

324
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,881
What's your plan?

325
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:16,412
I'll find the Blockbuster girl.

326
00:37:16,437 --> 00:37:20,447
I got word of a motorcycle thief
that fits her description.

327
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:23,348
If she can tell us why
these lizards are here...

328
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:25,850
Maybe she can tell us how
to kick 'em to the curb.

329
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:26,897
Good.

330
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,616
Do it alone, though. You
can't trust anyone.

331
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:35,006
- Not even our own men.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:52,010
Wow. They are big
bastards, aren't they?

333
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:55,752
Yeah, well. He's
no Brad Pitt, sir.

334
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:03,792
Safe journey to the beyond, my friend.

335
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:08,101
I will finish what we started.

336
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:18,973
I wouldn't get too
close there, boss.

337
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,706
No one in or out.

338
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:28,012
- What can I get you?
- Where was this photograph taken?

339
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:31,262
- Airport?
- Where's Pegasus?

340
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:36,528
That's classified. Not unlike
the file I've started on you.

341
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:41,248
I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.

342
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:42,842
Grunge is a good look for you.

343
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:45,639
- Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury?
- It's cool.

344
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,164
You know, had a space
invasion, big car chase...

345
00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:52,813
Got to watch an alien autopsy...

346
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:55,641
- Typical 9 to 5.
- So you saw one.

347
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,815
I was never one to
believe in aliens..

348
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:01,548
...but I can't unsee that.

349
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,395
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask...

350
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,997
You think I'm one of
those green things.

351
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:08,224
Can't be too careful.

352
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,052
You, are looking at 100%
red-blooded Earthman.

353
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:14,933
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

354
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:18,560
- We talking cheek swab or urine sample?
- No. The DNA would match.

355
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:19,595
Want my AOL password?

356
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,092
Skrulls can only sim recent
memories of their hosts' bodies.

357
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,130
You wanna get personal.

358
00:40:27,394 --> 00:40:29,037
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

359
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:30,769
But technically I don't
remember that part.

360
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:32,390
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snookers.

361
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:34,679
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said. Do I pass?

362
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:37,744
- Not yet. First job?
- Soldier. Straight outta high school.

363
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,228
Left with a rank of full colonel.

364
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,502
- Then?
- Spy.

365
00:40:40,527 --> 00:40:42,715
- Where?
- It's the Cold War. We were everywhere.

366
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:45,673
Belfast, Bucharest,
Belgrade, Budapest.

367
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:47,376
I like the B's. I
can make 'em rhyme.

368
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:48,001
Now?

369
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:49,853
Been riding a desk for the
past six years trying to

370
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:52,140
figure out where our future
enemies are coming from.

371
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:54,978
Never occured to me they
would be coming from above.

372
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:59,337
Name a detail so bizarre, a
Skrull can never fabricate it.

373
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:03,446
If a toast is cut
diagonally, I can't eat it.

374
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,185
You didn't need that, did you?

375
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,280
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

376
00:41:10,326 --> 00:41:13,654
Okay. Your turn. Prove
you're not a Skrull.

377
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:26,146
And how is that suppposed to
prove to me you're not a Skrull?

378
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:28,435
That's a photon blast.

379
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:30,889
- And?
- A Skrull can't do that.

380
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,865
So, a full-bred colonel turned
spy turned SHIELD Agent.

381
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:36,177
Must have pretty high
security clearance.

382
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,341
Where's Pegasus?

383
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:48,484
Okay. The Skrulls sim alien races to
infiltrate and take over planets...

384
00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:50,398
and you're a Kree.

385
00:41:50,414 --> 00:41:53,507
- A race of noble warriors.
- Heroes.

386
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:55,226
Noble warrior heroes.

387
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,890
So, what do Skrulls want with Dr.
Lawson?

388
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:03,962
They believe that she developed
a lightspeed engine at Pegasus.

389
00:42:03,978 --> 00:42:06,407
Lightspeed engine?

390
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:09,399
Gotta admit, that's not the
craziest thing I've heard today.

391
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:11,126
Well, it's still early.

392
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:13,391
And you? What do you want?

393
00:42:13,415 --> 00:42:16,157
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

394
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:17,338
And?

395
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:24,004
Look, war is a universal language.

396
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,028
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

397
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:30,419
You got a personal
stake in this.

398
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:43,088
This is government property.
Turn your vehicle around.

399
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:46,937
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of SHIELD.

400
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:48,999
Place your thumb on the pad.

401
00:42:50,023 --> 00:42:51,320
One moment.

402
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:55,523
Nicholas Joseph Fury?
You have three names?

403
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:57,853
Everybody calls me Fury.

404
00:42:57,878 --> 00:43:01,245
Not Nicholas, not Joseph, not Nick.
Just Fury.

405
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:03,010
- What does your Mom call you?
- Fury.

406
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:04,682
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

407
00:43:04,698 --> 00:43:06,885
- What about your kids?
- If I had them...

408
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,518
- they'll call me Fury.
- You're cleared for access.

409
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:10,543
Thank you.

410
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:41,726
Oh, hold up.

411
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,046
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.

412
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:48,437
Put that on.

413
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,452
- What is it?
- It's the SHIELD logo.

414
00:43:51,477 --> 00:43:55,682
Does announcing your identity on clothing
help with the covert part of your job?

415
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:58,580
Said the space soldier who
was wearing a rubber suit.

416
00:43:59,495 --> 00:44:00,948
Lose the flannel.

417
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:12,823
How can I help you?

418
00:44:13,598 --> 00:44:16,472
We're Agents of SHIELD.

419
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:20,033
We're looking for a
woman named Lawson.

420
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,267
Dr. Wendy Lawson.

421
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:25,379
Do you know her?

422
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:30,738
Follow me.

423
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:38,504
You familiar with the
phrase 'welcome wagon'?

424
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:40,692
No.

425
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:43,560
Well this ain't it.

426
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,852
- Is that a communicator?
- Yeah.

427
00:44:53,877 --> 00:44:55,944
State-of-the-art two-way pager.

428
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:59,094
- Who are you paging?
- My Mom. Don't worry.

429
00:44:59,126 --> 00:45:00,907
I didn't mention you.

430
00:45:01,788 --> 00:45:05,258
DETAINED WITH TARGET. NEED BACKUP

431
00:45:39,694 --> 00:45:40,817
After you.

432
00:45:40,842 --> 00:45:42,272
Impressive.

433
00:45:42,296 --> 00:45:45,363
You should see what I can
do with a paperclip.

434
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:58,878
Hey, how are you, huh?

435
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:03,175
Look at you. Just look at you!

436
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,532
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

437
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:07,943
Aren't you cute?
What's your name, huh?

438
00:46:08,013 --> 00:46:09,814
What's your name? "Goose".

439
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,956
Cool name for a cool cat.

440
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:13,237
Fury?

441
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:17,893
I'll be back.

442
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,557
Hold! Lemme get my fingerprint out.
Just let me unravel this...

443
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,462
You sat there, and watched me play with
tape, when all you had to do was...

444
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:34,892
I didn't want to
steal your thunder.

445
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,110
Lawson.

446
00:47:03,675 --> 00:47:06,341
Lawson's plan for the
lightspeed engine.

447
00:47:07,593 --> 00:47:09,979
I wonder why they
terminated the project.

448
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:15,436
Maybe because she's.... coo-coo.

449
00:47:17,032 --> 00:47:19,360
- Kree glyphs?
- Huh?

450
00:47:20,973 --> 00:47:23,426
Lawson is not coo-coo.

451
00:47:24,906 --> 00:47:26,180
She's Kree.

452
00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:30,640
- Well... she's dead.
- What?

453
00:47:31,153 --> 00:47:34,840
She crashed an Aces aircraft during
an unauthorized test flight.

454
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:36,910
Took a pilot down with her.

455
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,293
That's why security
here's so friendly.

456
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,123
They're covering up a
billion-dollar mistake.

457
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,458
Oh. And your lightspeed engine?
It's toast.

458
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:54,799
- When did this crash happen?
- Six years ago. 1989.

459
00:47:56,742 --> 00:47:58,726
Who was the pilot?

460
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:02,124
Most of this thing's
redacted, but...

461
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:08,984
there is a testimonial here from a Maria
Rambeau. Last person to see them alive.

462
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:20,923
Bag it.

463
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:52,836
This isn't about fighting wars.

464
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,347
It's about ending them.

465
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:02,681
I know Lawson was Kree.

466
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,565
She was here on C-53 and
died in a plane crash.

467
00:49:05,744 --> 00:49:08,204
Do you know anything about this?

468
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:11,416
I just discovered a mission
report sent from C-53.

469
00:49:11,509 --> 00:49:14,680
There's only so much I'm
cleared to tell you, Vers.

470
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:15,993
But...

471
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:23,282
Lawson, was an undercover Kree
operative named Mar-Vell.

472
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:26,953
She was working on a
unique energy core...

473
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,235
Experimenting with tech that apparently,

474
00:49:30,241 --> 00:49:32,592
could help us win the war.

475
00:49:38,566 --> 00:49:39,539
She still here?

476
00:49:39,564 --> 00:49:42,480
She's cooperating with
the investigation, sir.

477
00:49:42,636 --> 00:49:44,433
- You men, stay here.
- Yes, sir.

478
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,183
I want to question her alone.

479
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:50,578
Excellent work, Nicholas.

480
00:49:53,594 --> 00:49:55,594
Does it say anything about me?

481
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,883
Anything about you?
No, of course, not.

482
00:49:57,907 --> 00:49:59,053
Why would it?

483
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:02,406
I found evidence that I...
had a life here.

484
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:03,507
On C-53?

485
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:10,828
Mar-Vell is who I see when I visit the
Supreme Intelligence. I knew her.

486
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:12,788
And I knew her as Lawson.

487
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:14,601
This sounds like Skrull
simulation, Vers.

488
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:16,742
No, it's not because I remember.
I was here...

489
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,820
Stop. Remember your training.

490
00:50:18,845 --> 00:50:21,251
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

491
00:50:21,275 --> 00:50:24,829
Do not let your emotions
override your judgement.

492
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,904
She's on sub-level 6.
I'll get off on 5, hit

493
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:31,616
the stairs in case she
makes a run for it.

494
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,831
Do a pincer move. Like
we did in Havana.

495
00:50:35,885 --> 00:50:39,807
Right. Like we did in Havana.

496
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,868
We're nearing the jump point. Leave
your beacon on so I can find you.

497
00:50:53,024 --> 00:50:55,430
We'll get to the
bottom of this, Vers.

498
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,774
Together.

499
00:50:59,927 --> 00:51:00,927
Okay.

500
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:19,824
Vers!

501
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,160
Vers!

502
00:51:40,404 --> 00:51:42,225
Fury's colluding with the target.

503
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,592
Then why would he call us in?

504
00:51:43,616 --> 00:51:45,653
All I know is we take him in, too.
Dead or alive.

505
00:51:45,678 --> 00:51:47,412
Dead or alive?

506
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:03,447
Go! Go, go!

507
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:18,026
Was it something I said?

508
00:52:56,477 --> 00:53:00,836
Now, you know, I don't
really need these to see.

509
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,211
But...

510
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:05,360
They do kinda complete the look.

511
00:53:05,886 --> 00:53:07,429
Don't you think?

512
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:27,277
- You called it in?
- My bad!

513
00:53:41,195 --> 00:53:45,046
- Coulson! You have eyes on them?
- They're not down here.

514
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,382
Let's try up there.

515
00:53:56,365 --> 00:53:57,100
What?

516
00:53:57,124 --> 00:54:00,170
Your communicator. You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

517
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:32,331
Do you know how to
fly this thing?

518
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,643
Uhh, we'll see.

519
00:54:33,675 --> 00:54:35,831
That's a 'yes or no' question.

520
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:40,590
Yes.

521
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:46,059
That's what I'm talking about.

522
00:55:12,812 --> 00:55:14,671
We got a stowaway.

523
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:19,507
Hang on, Goose.

524
00:55:24,994 --> 00:55:26,040
Goose.

525
00:55:31,057 --> 00:55:33,940
Who's a good kitty, huh? Huh, Goose?

526
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:38,241
Yes, that's right. Who's
a good kitty, Goose?

527
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:41,610
- You the good kitty.
- See anyone you know?

528
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:44,336
Funny story...

529
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:48,312
I arrived on Hala,
near dead, no memory...

530
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,648
That was six years ago.

531
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:54,125
So you think, you're the pilot
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

532
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:57,664
I'm saying the last person to see
them alive will probably tell us.

533
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,883
- Maria Rambeau.
- So how do we get to Louisiana?

534
00:56:02,055 --> 00:56:04,968
Due east. Hang a
right on Memphis.

535
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:07,711
That agent...

536
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,349
That stopped the Skrulls
from finding us...

537
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:11,977
Coulson. The new guy.

538
00:56:12,317 --> 00:56:15,911
- I guess he doesn't hate me yet.
- Yeah, well. Give him time.

539
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,059
I guess he had a
feeling, you know.

540
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:21,519
Went with his gut against orders.

541
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:25,370
It's a really hard thing to do.
That's what keeps us human.

542
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:27,577
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

543
00:56:27,602 --> 00:56:29,999
I see that about you.

544
00:56:30,436 --> 00:56:33,771
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

545
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,663
I'm guessing that's not standard
Kree operating procedure.

546
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:40,499
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

547
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:49,050
Ronan.

548
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:51,239
The Accusers completed
their operation, but the

549
00:56:51,264 --> 00:56:53,561
greater mission was a failure
thanks to your team.

550
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:55,067
It was a trap.

551
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:57,973
To lure our operative Vers
to talk for her kidnapper.

552
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:00,762
Give us the location. We'll take
care of the terrorist threat.

553
00:57:00,801 --> 00:57:05,082
By bombing them out of the galaxy.
No.

554
00:57:05,357 --> 00:57:08,224
- We'll handle this.
- Son of Skrulls anywhere...

555
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:11,577
is a threat to Kree everywhere.
Where are they?

556
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:13,116
- They are...
- Lost.

557
00:57:14,636 --> 00:57:17,007
They are lost, for now.

558
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:18,765
But we will find them.

559
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,154
Do so.

560
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,826
Or we will.

561
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,870
Maintain the course for C-53.

562
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:50,267
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Maria Rambeau?

563
00:57:52,488 --> 00:57:53,988
Auntie Carol?

564
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,355
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

565
00:57:57,045 --> 00:57:59,566
I knew it! Everyone
said you were dead.

566
00:57:59,596 --> 00:58:02,099
But we knew they were lying.

567
00:58:03,953 --> 00:58:06,369
I'm not really who
you think I am.

568
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,167
- That is the craziest shit I ever heard.
- Green, transforming aliens?

569
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:22,109
- There's no such thing.
- You're absolutely right, young lady.

570
00:58:22,134 --> 00:58:24,980
There is  no such thing.
'Cause if there were...

571
00:58:25,011 --> 00:58:27,839
We would wanna keep
that to ourselves.

572
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,870
You don't believe me?

573
00:58:36,876 --> 00:58:39,656
No way. That's so cool.

574
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:43,391
She can do a lot more than
make tea with those hands.

575
00:58:43,415 --> 00:58:46,531
- Like what? Show us.
- Maybe later.

576
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,893
I kept all your stuff.
I'll go get it.

577
00:58:50,968 --> 00:58:53,436
You wanna give her
a hand with that?

578
00:59:08,766 --> 00:59:10,917
You don't remember anything?

579
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:13,344
I can see...

580
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:15,789
...flashes...

581
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:18,289
Little moments.

582
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,226
But I can't tell what's real.

583
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,906
If I can just piece together
what happened that morning...

584
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:29,185
Maybe it'll make sense.

585
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:35,628
You woke me up, banging
on my door at dawn.

586
00:59:35,653 --> 00:59:37,465
Your usual move.

587
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,310
Back then we had to
get up so early.

588
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:44,011
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat, so...

589
00:59:44,036 --> 00:59:47,503
testing Lawson's plane was our only
shot at doing something that mattered.

590
00:59:47,528 --> 00:59:50,457
And you wanted a race at the
base, in your old Mustang,

591
00:59:50,473 --> 00:59:53,285
and I wouldn't want to argue, 'cause
I knew my Camaro would dominate.

592
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:55,668
But you cheated.
Took a shortcut.

593
00:59:55,684 --> 00:59:57,011
Since when is a
shortcut cheating?

594
00:59:57,036 --> 00:59:59,504
Since it violates the predetermined
rules of engagement.

595
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,941
- I definitely don't remember those.
- Of course, you don't.

596
01:00:07,544 --> 01:00:09,349
When I got to the hangar...

597
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,677
Lawson was agitated.

598
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:16,513
She said she had lives to save.

599
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,435
She was trying to take the
Aces up herself, but you said...

600
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,712
"If there were lives at stake...

601
01:00:22,267 --> 01:00:24,087
I would fly the plane."

602
01:00:24,807 --> 01:00:27,939
Yup. Big hero moment.

603
01:00:28,302 --> 01:00:30,880
The kind of moment we've
both been waiting for.

604
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:34,207
The Doc was always unique.

605
01:00:34,544 --> 01:00:36,450
Felt like it, but.

606
01:00:37,036 --> 01:00:38,737
Now you're saying she's...

607
01:00:38,956 --> 01:00:41,088
from another planet.

608
01:00:41,776 --> 01:00:45,245
- I know this must be hard for you.
- What, this part right here?

609
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:47,675
No.

610
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,050
No. Mmm-mm.

611
01:00:51,808 --> 01:00:53,362
Know what's hard?

612
01:00:53,594 --> 01:00:55,596
It is losing my best friend

613
01:00:56,074 --> 01:00:59,925
in a mission so secret, they
act like it never even happened.

614
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:02,725
Hard...

615
01:01:03,762 --> 01:01:07,394
is knowing you were out there
somewhere, too damn stubborn to die.

616
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:11,581
And now you come up in
here after 6 years...

617
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:15,426
With your super-charged fire-hands
and you expect me to call you...

618
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:17,699
I don't even know what... "Vers"?

619
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:21,099
Is that really who you are now?

620
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:25,008
I don't know.

621
01:01:30,244 --> 01:01:31,713
Come look.

622
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:39,919
This is me and you on Halloween.

623
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:43,143
I'm Amelia Earhart, and
you're Janis Joplin.

624
01:01:43,206 --> 01:01:45,224
This is you when you were little.

625
01:01:45,249 --> 01:01:49,147
You didn't get along with your parents,
so Mom said we became your real family.

626
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,890
This is us on Christmas.

627
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:51,915
I got more...

628
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:54,124
Here's another picture of
you when you were little.

629
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:55,930
And this is how you
actually graduated...

630
01:02:05,153 --> 01:02:08,036
Oh, wait. I forgot, your jacket.

631
01:02:08,465 --> 01:02:12,019
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore
after i spilled ketchup on it.

632
01:02:24,732 --> 01:02:27,232
That was all that
survived the crash.

633
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:30,192
Or so we thought.

634
01:02:34,655 --> 01:02:36,045
Don't answer that.

635
01:02:36,783 --> 01:02:38,592
It's just my neighbor.

636
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,537
They can change into anyone.

637
01:02:45,663 --> 01:02:46,795
Hi, there.

638
01:02:47,343 --> 01:02:48,632
What do you want?

639
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:53,211
Hey, Tom. This is
my friend, Carol.

640
01:02:53,305 --> 01:02:54,805
Pleased to meet you!

641
01:02:56,254 --> 01:02:57,254
Yow!

642
01:02:57,645 --> 01:03:00,323
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

643
01:03:00,348 --> 01:03:02,949
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road,

644
01:03:02,981 --> 01:03:04,981
and I was just wondering
if you'd mind if I

645
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:07,395
bring the boys over to
get a closer looksie?

646
01:03:07,535 --> 01:03:09,144
- A closer looksie?
- Yeah.

647
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:12,730
To see the bird parked
out by the road.

648
01:03:14,308 --> 01:03:17,285
You're really working overtime
to sell this one, aren't you...

649
01:03:17,316 --> 01:03:18,503
Talos?

650
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,823
I'm sorry, Tom. This
isn't a good time.

651
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:25,439
I'll come by tomorrow? Okay?

652
01:03:27,822 --> 01:03:31,064
You know, you really should
be kinder to your neighbors.

653
01:03:31,379 --> 01:03:34,157
You never know when you're gonna
need to borrow some sugar.

654
01:03:37,937 --> 01:03:39,312
Hang on a second.

655
01:03:39,702 --> 01:03:43,296
Before you go swinging
those jazz-hands around,

656
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:46,289
making a mess in
your friend's house,

657
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:49,929
- and... it's a lovely home.
- Oh, my God...

658
01:03:50,046 --> 01:03:51,382
What the hell?!

659
01:03:55,363 --> 01:03:59,880
No one's gonna hurt the girl.
Just, don't kill me.

660
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:02,008
It can really complicate
the situation.

661
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:06,374
I'm about 5 seconds from complicating that
wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

662
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:11,102
I'm sorry I simmed your boss. But now
I stand before you as my true self.

663
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:14,452
- Without deception.
- And who's that out there?

664
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:17,138
Okay. That's a fair point.

665
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:19,170
But I'm sure that
you understand,

666
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,327
I had to take some precautions.

667
01:04:21,343 --> 01:04:24,725
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

668
01:04:24,763 --> 01:04:27,335
with your hands bound.
I just wanna talk.

669
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,710
The last time we talked, I ended
up hanging from my ankles.

670
01:04:29,749 --> 01:04:32,397
That was before I
knew who you were.

671
01:04:32,444 --> 01:04:35,600
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

672
01:04:36,562 --> 01:04:39,068
I have an audio
recording from Pegasus,

673
01:04:39,093 --> 01:04:43,194
with your voice, from a
plane crash, six years ago.

674
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:47,764
On a device I believe
you call a "black box".

675
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:52,178
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.
How'd you get it?

676
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:55,331
Does she not understand? Young lady
I have a special skill that kinda

677
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:58,636
allows me to get into places
I'm not supposed to be in.

678
01:04:58,738 --> 01:05:02,769
Call me young lady again, and I'm gonna put
my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.

679
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:06,882
Am I supposed to
guess, where that is?

680
01:05:07,217 --> 01:05:08,530
- Your ass.
- Your ass.

681
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:11,171
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

682
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:14,850
But look, I just need your help
decoding some coordinates.

683
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:17,147
If you sit down, you
listen to this,

684
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:20,468
I assure you, it'll
be worth your while.

685
01:05:22,695 --> 01:05:25,054
Call your buddy back
inside and I'll listen.

686
01:05:25,664 --> 01:05:26,664
Deal.

687
01:05:27,476 --> 01:05:28,601
Oh, my God!

688
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:31,366
Get that thing away!
How'd that get in here?

689
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,484
The cat? This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

690
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:39,737
That's not a cat.
That's a Flerken.

691
01:05:39,808 --> 01:05:42,659
- A Flerken?
- Mom?

692
01:05:50,216 --> 01:05:52,973
- Monica...
- Why can't I listen too?

693
01:06:20,406 --> 01:06:21,914
What's happening?

694
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:23,289
It's loading.

695
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:32,837
Punch in the coordinates:
5239, -47, 8.768, 0.2.

696
01:06:32,862 --> 01:06:35,213
Copy that. Where
are we going, Doc?

697
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:38,102
- My laboratory.
- Your laboratory?

698
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,571
- What do you mean?
- Oh, no.

699
01:06:40,587 --> 01:06:44,235
Is that... Wait, what is that?
It's not showing up on my radar.

700
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,033
Go, Carol. Fly!

701
01:06:46,073 --> 01:06:47,073
That's no () Lawson.

702
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:49,533
- Who the hell are they?
- Those are the bad guys.

703
01:06:49,557 --> 01:06:51,768
- Fly faster, now.
- Yes, ma'am.

704
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,845
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

705
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:02,029
I never should have
brought you along.

706
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:08,795
Here comes some G's.

707
01:07:27,095 --> 01:07:29,329
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

708
01:07:40,094 --> 01:07:42,710
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

709
01:07:45,453 --> 01:07:47,843
Stay with me, Lawson!

710
01:08:05,221 --> 01:08:06,822
Danvers, do you copy?

711
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:09,175
Yeah, I copy. On the ground.

712
01:08:09,214 --> 01:08:13,284
- Can anyone hear me?
- Yeah. I copy.

713
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:16,657
Doc?

714
01:08:17,782 --> 01:08:18,860
Your blood...

715
01:08:20,352 --> 01:08:21,696
it's blue.

716
01:08:21,821 --> 01:08:23,243
Never mind that.

717
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:25,516
How's my hair?

718
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:28,360
Help me out, will you?

719
01:08:31,978 --> 01:08:36,087
- I have to destroy it before they get here.
- What... Lawson?

720
01:08:36,635 --> 01:08:40,783
You remember what I said about
my work here? What it's for?

721
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,525
- To end wars?
- Yeah.

722
01:08:43,721 --> 01:08:46,642
But the wars are
bigger than you know.

723
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:48,517
Damn it!

724
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:52,363
My name is not Lawson.

725
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:55,144
My real name, is Mar-Vell...

726
01:08:55,184 --> 01:08:58,339
and I come from a
planet called Hala.

727
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:01,754
I'd say you were
delusional, but...

728
01:09:01,777 --> 01:09:04,925
we just got shot down by a
spaceship, and your blood is blue.

729
01:09:05,702 --> 01:09:08,933
Listen. I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

730
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:12,827
Now skedaddle before you
give me any more regrets.

731
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:15,202
Just remember the
coordinates, okay?

732
01:09:15,288 --> 01:09:17,491
You got to save them without me.

733
01:09:17,507 --> 01:09:18,694
Save who? How?

734
01:09:18,718 --> 01:09:21,334
No, I got to blow this
engine before they find it.

735
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:22,827
What are you doing?

736
01:09:42,954 --> 01:09:45,287
We have no interest
in hurting you.

737
01:09:45,619 --> 01:09:46,619
No?!

738
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:49,720
Because all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

739
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:53,055
The energy core...

740
01:09:53,165 --> 01:09:54,492
Where is it?

741
01:09:54,532 --> 01:09:57,094
Pararescue's on the way.

742
01:09:57,258 --> 01:09:59,711
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

743
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:02,078
Then I see no reason to
prolong this conversation.

744
01:10:02,094 --> 01:10:03,195
No, wait!

745
01:10:09,842 --> 01:10:11,967
You mean that energy core?

746
01:11:00,394 --> 01:11:02,894
Commander. She's still moving.

747
01:11:03,074 --> 01:11:05,331
- Permission to fire.
- Hold your fire.

748
01:11:14,876 --> 01:11:18,758
There's nothing left. The
core has been destroyed.

749
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:23,068
"VERS"

750
01:11:28,177 --> 01:11:30,614
She absorbed its' power.

751
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:34,177
She's coming with us.

752
01:11:55,175 --> 01:11:56,583
He lied to me.

753
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:02,183
- Everything that I knew was a lie.
- Now...

754
01:12:02,496 --> 01:12:04,909
- ...you understand.
- What?

755
01:12:05,097 --> 01:12:06,651
What do I understand now?

756
01:12:06,675 --> 01:12:09,948
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.
He killed her.

757
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:13,659
Because she found out that
she was on the wrong side

758
01:12:13,825 --> 01:12:15,980
of an unjust war.

759
01:12:16,005 --> 01:12:19,630
No. Your people
are terrorists...

760
01:12:19,638 --> 01:12:22,559
that kill innocents. I
saw the ruins on Torfa.

761
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:26,122
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

762
01:12:26,732 --> 01:12:30,593
My people lived as
refugees, on Torfa.

763
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:33,772
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule,

764
01:12:33,797 --> 01:12:36,148
and they destroyed our planet.

765
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:39,523
Now the handful of
us that are left,

766
01:12:39,883 --> 01:12:41,898
will be slaughtered next.

767
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:46,289
Unless, you will help me
finish what Mar-Vell started.

768
01:12:47,422 --> 01:12:49,540
The coordinates you
found, would've powered

769
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:53,752
a lightspeed ship capable of
carrying us to safety. A new home.

770
01:12:54,177 --> 01:12:56,619
Where the Kree can't reach us.

771
01:12:57,771 --> 01:13:01,817
Lawson always told us that her work
at Pegasus wasn't to fight wars...

772
01:13:01,896 --> 01:13:03,411
But to end them.

773
01:13:03,575 --> 01:13:08,895
She wanted you to help
us find the core.

774
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:11,328
Well, I already destroyed it.

775
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:15,868
No, you destroyed the engine. The core
that powers it is on a remote location.

776
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:19,821
If you help us decode
those coordinates...

777
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:21,970
We can find it.

778
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:26,116
You'll use it to destroy us.

779
01:13:29,148 --> 01:13:30,828
We just want a home.

780
01:13:34,946 --> 01:13:40,187
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

781
01:13:40,204 --> 01:13:42,164
Can't you see it now?

782
01:13:42,196 --> 01:13:44,711
You're not one of them.

783
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:48,414
You don't know me.

784
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:52,167
You have no idea who I am.

785
01:13:54,277 --> 01:13:56,417
I don't even know who I am.

786
01:13:57,941 --> 01:14:00,542
You are Carol Danvers.

787
01:14:01,274 --> 01:14:04,750
You are the woman on that
black box risking her life

788
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,625
to do the right thing.

789
01:14:07,962 --> 01:14:09,673
My best friend...

790
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:11,930
who supported me as a mother,

791
01:14:11,955 --> 01:14:14,318
and a pilot when
no one else did.

792
01:14:14,846 --> 01:14:19,643
You're smart, and funny, and
a huge pain in the ass.

793
01:14:20,183 --> 01:14:23,542
And you are the most
powerful person I know.

794
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,464
Way before you can shoot
fire from your fist.

795
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,628
Do you hear me?

796
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:31,924
Do you hear me?

797
01:14:47,237 --> 01:14:51,104
I know I don't deserve
your trust, but...

798
01:14:51,104 --> 01:14:53,049
you're our only lead.

799
01:14:53,143 --> 01:14:55,408
We discovered that
your energy signature

800
01:14:55,456 --> 01:14:58,385
matched Mar-Vell's core.

801
01:14:59,222 --> 01:15:00,831
Now, we know why.

802
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:07,183
If only you knew, the
importance of it to me.

803
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:09,479
I just need your help.

804
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:13,339
Decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

805
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:17,137
Those weren't coordinates.
They're safe vectors.

806
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,214
Orbital positioning and philosophy.

807
01:15:19,252 --> 01:15:22,417
You didn't find her lab on Earth,
because it's not on Earth.

808
01:15:22,463 --> 01:15:25,025
That was the location on the day
of the crash six years ago.

809
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:28,517
If we track its course, we'll
find it, in orbit, right now.

810
01:15:28,533 --> 01:15:31,009
It's just basic physics.

811
01:15:33,072 --> 01:15:34,525
In our orbit?

812
01:15:35,525 --> 01:15:40,173
Was that so difficult to figure out? I
mean, you're my science guy, right?

813
01:15:40,408 --> 01:15:43,025
Yon-Rogg will catch
up to us soon.

814
01:15:43,174 --> 01:15:45,697
We've got to get to the
core before he does.

815
01:15:45,705 --> 01:15:47,650
You're going to space?

816
01:15:47,728 --> 01:15:48,853
In what?

817
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,822
A few tweaks to your
vessel should do it.

818
01:15:50,853 --> 01:15:52,798
I can handle the modifications.

819
01:15:52,823 --> 01:15:54,845
Hmm. Your science guy.

820
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,453
Well, I could use a co-pilot.

821
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:07,297
No. No, I... I can't.

822
01:16:07,321 --> 01:16:09,821
- I can't leave Monica.
- Why?

823
01:16:09,852 --> 01:16:12,336
It's okay. I can stay
with grandma and poppa.

824
01:16:12,361 --> 01:16:14,580
There's no way I'm going baby.
It's too dangerous.

825
01:16:14,605 --> 01:16:18,384
Testing for new aerospace tech is
dangerous. Didn't you use to do that?

826
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:23,126
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in
a craft not designed for the journey,

827
01:16:23,134 --> 01:16:27,634
and you anticipate hostile encounters with
a technologically superior foreign enemy.

828
01:16:27,665 --> 01:16:28,751
Correct?

829
01:16:29,267 --> 01:16:31,376
- That's what I'm saying. You have to go.
- Monica...

830
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:33,868
You will just fly the coolest
mission in the history of missions.

831
01:16:33,884 --> 01:16:37,571
And you're gonna give it up to sit on the
couch and watch Fresh Prince with me?

832
01:16:38,438 --> 01:16:40,680
I just think you should
consider what kind of

833
01:16:40,705 --> 01:16:43,212
example you're setting
for your daughter.

834
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:02,062
Your Mom's lucky.

835
01:17:02,554 --> 01:17:05,687
When they were handing out kids,
they gave her the toughest one.

836
01:17:06,063 --> 01:17:07,648
Lieutenant Trouble.

837
01:17:08,062 --> 01:17:09,664
You remember.

838
01:17:11,141 --> 01:17:12,445
Is that mine?

839
01:17:13,305 --> 01:17:14,500
Oh, no.

840
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:17,930
You hang on to it
until I come back.

841
01:17:18,657 --> 01:17:21,258
But there is something that
I need your help with.

842
01:17:21,289 --> 01:17:23,680
I can't wear these
Kree colors anymore.

843
01:17:24,094 --> 01:17:28,648
And since you're obviously the only person
around here with any sense of style...

844
01:17:32,828 --> 01:17:33,828
Whoa.

845
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:38,125
No.

846
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,560
Uh-uhh.

847
01:17:42,841 --> 01:17:44,474
Definitely not.

848
01:17:47,521 --> 01:17:49,988
Well, since we're
on the same team...

849
01:18:03,384 --> 01:18:04,767
How do I look?

850
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:09,704
Fresh.

851
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:31,412
What took you so long?

852
01:18:31,905 --> 01:18:34,537
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

853
01:18:34,779 --> 01:18:37,068
- PRY46--
- Enough with codes.

854
01:18:37,115 --> 01:18:39,443
The system is fallible
as we've learned.

855
01:18:40,185 --> 01:18:41,997
Okay. Then let's do this.

856
01:18:42,387 --> 01:18:45,879
Who do I see, when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

857
01:18:45,918 --> 01:18:48,605
A person you most admire
and respect, I guess.

858
01:18:48,731 --> 01:18:51,098
But you would never tell me who.

859
01:18:51,543 --> 01:18:54,534
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

860
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:56,191
A transfusion.

861
01:18:56,254 --> 01:18:58,654
Blue blood running
through my veins.

862
01:18:58,723 --> 01:19:00,356
Whose blood?

863
01:19:10,318 --> 01:19:12,084
That is my blood,

864
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:14,528
that's coursing
through her veins.

865
01:19:19,616 --> 01:19:23,014
- What have you done to her?
- You're too late.

866
01:19:39,699 --> 01:19:41,245
She knows?

867
01:19:55,121 --> 01:19:59,519
Ronan. Skrulls have infiltrated C-53.
Come at once.

868
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:02,050
For the good of all
Kree, Commander.

869
01:20:02,058 --> 01:20:04,511
The infestation
will be eradicated.

870
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:09,590
Passing 500 and climbing.

871
01:20:12,192 --> 01:20:15,246
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

872
01:20:15,271 --> 01:20:18,581
My alliance with you,
it's tenuous at best.

873
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:22,661
But as long as he continues
to freak you out...

874
01:20:28,595 --> 01:20:30,280
Can I ask you something?

875
01:20:30,296 --> 01:20:32,358
You just turn into
anything you want?

876
01:20:32,383 --> 01:20:35,554
- Well, I have to see it first.
- Can you all do it?

877
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:38,378
Physiologically, yeah. But...

878
01:20:38,403 --> 01:20:43,590
It takes practice, and dare I
say it, talent to do what...

879
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:45,418
Can you turn into a cat?

880
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,376
What's a cat?

881
01:20:46,401 --> 01:20:48,160
What about a filing cabinet?

882
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,207
Why would I turn into
a filing cabinet...?

883
01:20:51,284 --> 01:20:55,127
A venus fly trap. I'll give you $50 right
now if you turn into a venus fly trap.

884
01:20:55,441 --> 01:20:59,465
Engine, this is scrammed jet fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

885
01:21:09,276 --> 01:21:13,314
- Is this normal, like space turbulence?
- Pretty much.

886
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:48,797
Locking in a coordinate grid.

887
01:21:49,336 --> 01:21:51,093
Where is it?

888
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:56,273
It's here. It's gotta be here.

889
01:21:56,961 --> 01:21:59,046
Or is it in front?

890
01:21:59,109 --> 01:22:02,171
Or are we actually behind it?

891
01:22:07,948 --> 01:22:10,346
Decloaking activated.

892
01:23:12,627 --> 01:23:14,595
Is that it? The core?

893
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:17,525
In her notes, she called
it the Tesseract.

894
01:23:25,413 --> 01:23:28,317
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

895
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,018
We're not alone.

896
01:24:05,762 --> 01:24:06,762
Talos!

897
01:24:17,036 --> 01:24:19,848
You didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

898
01:24:48,903 --> 01:24:50,645
We didn't know what to do.

899
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:53,996
Mar-Vell warned us not to
send a signal for any reason.

900
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:57,919
- Or the Kree would find us.
- You did the right thing.

901
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,462
It's okay. It's okay.

902
01:25:09,517 --> 01:25:11,517
She's alright. She's a friend.

903
01:25:13,587 --> 01:25:15,243
I am not gonna hurt you.

904
01:25:15,321 --> 01:25:17,445
She led me to you.

905
01:25:17,744 --> 01:25:19,900
I'm so sorry.

906
01:25:21,205 --> 01:25:22,619
I didn't know.

907
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:24,064
Carol...

908
01:25:24,408 --> 01:25:26,423
this is war.

909
01:25:27,181 --> 01:25:30,267
My hands are filthy
from it, too.

910
01:25:31,353 --> 01:25:35,681
But we're here now.
You found my family.

911
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:44,892
This is just the beginning. There's
thousands of us separated from each other.

912
01:25:45,745 --> 01:25:48,424
Scattered throughout the galaxy.

913
01:26:06,511 --> 01:26:11,089
If I played the same pinball machine for
6 years, I'd have some high scores, too.

914
01:26:13,623 --> 01:26:15,954
Fraternizing with the enemy.

915
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:16,963
Uh-uh.

916
01:26:29,026 --> 01:26:31,292
What did you do to your uniform?

917
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,338
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

918
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:35,315
The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.

919
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:38,128
You can see they're not soldiers.
Let them go.

920
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:40,721
- You can have me.
- And the core?

921
01:26:40,869 --> 01:26:42,290
You lied to me.

922
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:46,236
I made you a better
version of yourself.

923
01:26:49,636 --> 01:26:52,979
What's given can be taken away.

924
01:27:52,793 --> 01:27:54,121
There she is.

925
01:27:54,176 --> 01:27:58,129
Seems like you flying on
C-53 jogged the old memory.

926
01:27:58,559 --> 01:28:02,980
This jacket? It's
killer, by the way.

927
01:28:05,291 --> 01:28:07,548
The music, it's a nice touch.

928
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:11,040
- Let... me... out.
- No can do.

929
01:28:11,253 --> 01:28:15,253
If you hurt them, I will
burn you to the ground.

930
01:28:15,292 --> 01:28:16,807
With what, exactly?

931
01:28:17,253 --> 01:28:20,838
- Your power comes from us.
- You didn't give me these powers.

932
01:28:20,855 --> 01:28:21,854
The blast did.

933
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:25,401
And yet, you've never had the
strength to control them on your own.

934
01:28:35,676 --> 01:28:38,886
Species: Flerken. Threat: High.

935
01:28:44,499 --> 01:28:47,374
It's a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter.

936
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:51,715
Species: Human male.

937
01:28:51,731 --> 01:28:54,230
Threat: Low to none.

938
01:28:55,191 --> 01:28:56,628
That thing is clearly busted.

939
01:28:56,644 --> 01:28:58,761
Load the Flerken on the heli.

940
01:28:59,276 --> 01:29:01,394
Eject the others to space.

941
01:29:04,348 --> 01:29:06,378
You did good, ace.

942
01:29:07,871 --> 01:29:12,878
Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters
will threaten our borders no more.

943
01:29:12,918 --> 01:29:17,449
I used to believe your lies. But the
Skrulls are just fighting for a home.

944
01:29:17,832 --> 01:29:21,355
You're talking about destroying them
because they won't submit to your rule.

945
01:29:21,462 --> 01:29:22,704
And neither will I.

946
01:29:22,785 --> 01:29:23,923
We found you.

947
01:29:23,955 --> 01:29:26,962
- We embraced you as our own.
- You stole me.

948
01:29:27,396 --> 01:29:30,736
From my home. My family.
My friends.

949
01:29:38,617 --> 01:29:40,710
It's cute how hard you try.

950
01:29:42,757 --> 01:29:43,952
Remember...

951
01:29:45,351 --> 01:29:46,921
Without us...

952
01:29:46,968 --> 01:29:47,968
Give it up, Carol!

953
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:51,835
... you're weak.

954
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:55,678
You're flawed.

955
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:58,928
Helpless.

956
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:04,265
We saved you.

957
01:30:13,559 --> 01:30:16,433
Without us, you are only human.

958
01:30:18,082 --> 01:30:19,581
You're right.

959
01:30:20,746 --> 01:30:22,605
I'm only human.

960
01:30:56,649 --> 01:30:59,899
On Hala, you are reborn.

961
01:31:00,212 --> 01:31:01,453
Vers.

962
01:31:06,485 --> 01:31:09,758
My name... is Carol.

963
01:31:24,132 --> 01:31:26,022
She's trying to break out.

964
01:32:09,911 --> 01:32:13,378
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

965
01:32:14,263 --> 01:32:16,279
But what happens when...

966
01:32:18,974 --> 01:32:20,849
... I'm finally set free?

967
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:04,138
You, know you're glowing, right?

968
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:05,772
I'll explain it later.

969
01:33:07,945 --> 01:33:10,545
Take the Tesseract.
Leave the lunchbox.

970
01:33:10,796 --> 01:33:12,366
- Me?
- Yes.

971
01:33:12,421 --> 01:33:15,882
- I'm not touching that thing.
- Want me to get you an oven mitt?

972
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:30,793
Get the Skrulls from
the quadrant, and go.

973
01:33:30,879 --> 01:33:33,183
Take the Flerken with you.

974
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,816
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time.

975
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:40,004
I'm picking you up now.

976
01:33:42,543 --> 01:33:45,082
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

977
01:33:50,496 --> 01:33:51,923
Hey, guys.

978
01:33:55,095 --> 01:33:57,579
Arm-wrestle for the Tesseract?

979
01:33:59,947 --> 01:34:01,985
I used to find you amusing.

980
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:05,438
Let's put an end to this!

981
01:34:38,891 --> 01:34:40,117
Okay!

982
01:34:40,157 --> 01:34:41,648
Good kitty!

983
01:35:28,003 --> 01:35:29,549
You knew all along.

984
01:35:30,854 --> 01:35:32,103
Is that why we never hung out?

985
01:35:32,128 --> 01:35:34,354
No. I just never liked you.

986
01:35:49,826 --> 01:35:51,786
Hey! In a hurry?

987
01:35:53,255 --> 01:35:55,810
- Don't make me do this.
- Okay.

988
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:14,197
Now! Come on! Do your thing.

989
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:19,705
Come on!

990
01:36:22,393 --> 01:36:24,893
Dammit, Goose. Pick a side.

991
01:36:29,153 --> 01:36:33,238
Take them to the hangar tube.
We'll blast them all into space.

992
01:36:35,161 --> 01:36:36,590
Play it cool.

993
01:36:37,793 --> 01:36:39,465
Just like Havana.

994
01:36:40,527 --> 01:36:44,831
- Do you have the thing?
- The Flerken kitty ate it.

995
01:36:57,915 --> 01:36:59,978
Come on. Move. Move!

996
01:37:00,955 --> 01:37:02,650
Follow my lead.

997
01:37:06,455 --> 01:37:08,212
Cover her eyes.

998
01:37:16,472 --> 01:37:19,315
Go to the ship. Let's go.
Let's go.

999
01:37:42,764 --> 01:37:44,373
Nice diversion.

1000
01:37:44,467 --> 01:37:47,084
I could've swore, I
put it in there.

1001
01:38:43,303 --> 01:38:46,686
- Minn-Erva, take them down in a dropship.
- On it.

1002
01:38:51,376 --> 01:38:52,933
You all right, friend?

1003
01:38:53,306 --> 01:38:55,086
Never... better.

1004
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:02,508
We've got a bogey.
Coming in hot.

1005
01:40:41,739 --> 01:40:42,793
Yes!

1006
01:41:04,126 --> 01:41:05,649
What the hell was that?

1007
01:41:28,634 --> 01:41:30,728
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1008
01:42:23,028 --> 01:42:24,645
That's impossible.

1009
01:42:24,785 --> 01:42:29,582
C-53 doesn't have a defense system
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

1010
01:42:31,129 --> 01:42:33,729
That's not their
defense system, Ronan.

1011
01:42:37,996 --> 01:42:39,637
Take her down.

1012
01:43:49,586 --> 01:43:51,492
Return to the jump point.

1013
01:43:52,664 --> 01:43:54,796
We'll be back for the weapon.

1014
01:43:56,113 --> 01:43:57,566
The core?

1015
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:00,917
The woman.

1016
01:44:48,528 --> 01:44:50,575
I'm so proud of you.

1017
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:55,567
You've come a long way since I
found you that day by the lake.

1018
01:44:56,412 --> 01:45:00,091
But can you keep your emotions in
check long enough to take me on?

1019
01:45:00,881 --> 01:45:03,396
Or will it get the better
of you, as always?

1020
01:45:04,975 --> 01:45:06,678
I always told you...

1021
01:45:06,865 --> 01:45:10,474
you'll be ready, the day you can
knock me down as yourself.

1022
01:45:10,591 --> 01:45:14,450
This is that moment. This
is that moment, Vers!

1023
01:45:15,045 --> 01:45:18,021
Turn off the light show,
and prove, prove to me,

1024
01:45:18,037 --> 01:45:19,818
you can beat me with...

1025
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:37,125
I have nothing to prove to you.

1026
01:45:52,618 --> 01:45:54,638
Destination: Hala.

1027
01:45:54,728 --> 01:45:58,415
- I can't go back empty-handed.
- You won't be empty-handed.

1028
01:45:58,689 --> 01:46:00,977
I'm sending you with a message.

1029
01:46:01,103 --> 01:46:04,588
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1030
01:46:04,613 --> 01:46:07,760
The war, the lies, all of it.

1031
01:46:09,058 --> 01:46:10,627
You can't do this.

1032
01:46:29,298 --> 01:46:32,990
That was a close call, huh, Goosey?
Huh?

1033
01:46:34,157 --> 01:46:36,539
The bad guy's still in
there somewhere--- Oh!

1034
01:46:36,563 --> 01:46:38,032
Mother Flerken!

1035
01:46:38,063 --> 01:46:41,195
- You okay?
- Yeah. It's just a scratch.

1036
01:46:41,563 --> 01:46:42,734
No...

1037
01:46:51,806 --> 01:46:54,634
I can't believe you got into
the raddest dogfight ever.

1038
01:46:54,642 --> 01:46:56,811
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1039
01:46:56,836 --> 01:46:59,211
That's some nifty flying
you did out there.

1040
01:46:59,234 --> 01:47:01,615
SHIELD could always
use a good pilot like you.

1041
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,013
I'll consider it.

1042
01:47:03,029 --> 01:47:06,107
As long as you don't call
my flying nifty again.

1043
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:08,411
How's your eye?

1044
01:47:08,622 --> 01:47:09,959
It never hurt a second.

1045
01:47:09,984 --> 01:47:14,437
Just so I'm clear, you were
Soh-Larr, and the SHIELD agent?

1046
01:47:14,461 --> 01:47:15,461
Keller.

1047
01:47:15,468 --> 01:47:18,001
Tagged my boss up,
stole his identity.

1048
01:47:18,163 --> 01:47:20,921
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1049
01:47:20,952 --> 01:47:24,030
It's a little like thief.

1050
01:47:24,218 --> 01:47:28,764
You're good to go ahead till you recover,
but you and your family need another look.

1051
01:47:28,968 --> 01:47:31,678
- I could go back to being your boss.
- Please don't.

1052
01:47:31,703 --> 01:47:34,467
Come on. I love sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1053
01:47:34,485 --> 01:47:39,360
No way, you guys have the best eyes.
Don't ever change your eyes.

1054
01:47:42,964 --> 01:47:44,729
I'll help you find a home.

1055
01:47:44,854 --> 01:47:47,080
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1056
01:47:48,878 --> 01:47:52,487
They can stay here with
us, can't they, Mom?

1057
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:55,222
They won't be safe here, baby.

1058
01:47:55,332 --> 01:47:59,152
Auntie Carol is right.
They need their own home.

1059
01:47:59,215 --> 01:48:01,964
I'll be back before you know it.

1060
01:48:02,183 --> 01:48:04,574
Maybe I can fly up and
meet you halfway.

1061
01:48:04,753 --> 01:48:07,346
Only if you learn how to
gloat, like your Auntie Carol.

1062
01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:09,956
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.
You don't know.

1063
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:11,667
He doesn't.

1064
01:48:20,695 --> 01:48:24,827
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.
Hidden.

1065
01:48:24,874 --> 01:48:27,674
You're sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1066
01:48:27,883 --> 01:48:30,335
- Mar-Vell.
- That's what I said.

1067
01:48:30,367 --> 01:48:33,054
It's two words. Mar-Vell.

1068
01:48:33,078 --> 01:48:34,296
Marvel.

1069
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:37,851
Marvel sounds a lot better. You
know, like the Marvelettes?

1070
01:48:50,963 --> 01:48:52,220
Not ringing any bells?

1071
01:48:52,245 --> 01:48:55,448
Keep singing. Maybe it
will come back to me.

1072
01:49:09,408 --> 01:49:11,454
I upgraded it.

1073
01:49:11,583 --> 01:49:15,043
Range should be, a couple
galaxies, at least.

1074
01:49:16,489 --> 01:49:18,932
What? You think I'm
gonna crank call you?

1075
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:22,597
For emergencies only. Okay?

1076
01:49:29,828 --> 01:49:32,085
Well, if you're ever
passing back through this

1077
01:49:32,110 --> 01:49:34,655
galaxy, be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1078
01:49:50,915 --> 01:49:53,036
We got the ketchup stain off.

1079
01:49:58,463 --> 01:50:00,893
Thanks, Lt. Trouble.

1080
01:50:09,501 --> 01:50:12,266
It's hard for me to
say goodbye, too.

1081
01:50:25,663 --> 01:50:26,845
Go on.

1082
01:51:34,215 --> 01:51:36,015
Glad to have you back, sir.

1083
01:51:36,053 --> 01:51:37,611
This came for you.

1084
01:51:41,491 --> 01:51:43,376
So, is it true?

1085
01:51:43,955 --> 01:51:47,782
That the Kree burned your eye out because
you refused to give them the Tesseract?

1086
01:51:48,812 --> 01:51:52,366
I'll neither confirm nor deny
the facts of that story.

1087
01:51:52,531 --> 01:51:53,897
Understood.

1088
01:51:55,398 --> 01:51:57,615
I'm sorry to report that we still
haven't found the Tesseract.

1089
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:00,030
I'm sure it will
turn up somewhere.

1090
01:52:01,351 --> 01:52:03,148
I'll let you know when it does.

1091
01:52:03,172 --> 01:52:04,327
Then what?

1092
01:52:05,508 --> 01:52:06,508
Sir?

1093
01:52:06,617 --> 01:52:10,788
We have no idea what other
intergalactic threats are out there.

1094
01:52:10,828 --> 01:52:13,378
And our one-woman security
force had a prior

1095
01:52:13,403 --> 01:52:16,390
commitment on the other
side of the universe.

1096
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:21,704
SHIELD alone can't protect us.

1097
01:52:22,837 --> 01:52:24,993
We need to find more.

1098
01:52:25,111 --> 01:52:27,423
- More weapons?
- More heroes.

1099
01:52:27,579 --> 01:52:29,258
You think we can find
others like her?

1100
01:52:29,299 --> 01:52:32,173
We found her and we
weren't even looking.

1101
01:52:33,416 --> 01:52:34,884
Get some rest, sir.

1102
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:38,220
You got a big decision to make.

1103
01:53:14,489 --> 01:53:15,822
